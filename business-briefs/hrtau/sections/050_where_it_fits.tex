\section*{Where \HRtau\ Fits in Forecast Readiness}

Tolerance calibration operates upstream of readiness evaluation. It defines the acceptability envelope within which tolerance-based metrics such as \HRtau\ are interpreted.

Within the Forecast Readiness Framework, calibrated tolerance plays a role analogous to cost-ratio calibration in cost-weighted loss metrics. Both establish governed assumptions that shape how performance is judged, without altering the forecasts themselves.

\HRtau\ is not an optimization target and should not be adjusted to favor particular models or outcomes. Its role is evaluative and structural: to ensure that readiness assessment is conducted within a transparent, stable, and auditable tolerance regime.

Positioned this way, tolerance calibration strengthens forecast governance. It makes readiness standards explicit, separates assumption from measurement, and ensures that tolerance-based metrics remain interpretable and decision-relevant across models, entities, and time horizons.
