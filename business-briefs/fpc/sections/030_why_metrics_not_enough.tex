\section*{Why Metrics Alone Are Not Enough}

Readiness metrics describe how a forecast fails, but they do not explain why those failures persist. Measures such as coverage, tolerance compliance, severity, and cost exposure can all signal risk without revealing whether that risk is addressable within the current forecasting paradigm.

In compatible regimes, readiness metrics respond predictably to intervention. Coverage improves with adjustment, tolerance increases smoothly, and cost trade-offs remain interpretable. In incompatible regimes, the same metrics stagnate or behave erratically despite increasingly aggressive tuning.

Without a structural diagnostic, these patterns are easy to misinterpret. Weak responsiveness may be mistaken for insufficient effort rather than evidence that the forecast primitive itself is misaligned with demand behavior.

FPC fills this gap by synthesizing metric behavior across interventions. It does not replace readiness diagnostics, but contextualizes them, distinguishing between failures that are tunable and failures that are structural.
