\section*{The Core Insight: Decisions Require a Deterministic Contract}

Operational decisions require closure. For a given set of conditions, exactly one interpretation must govern, exactly one policy must apply, and responsibility must be clearly assigned.

The key insight is that governance must operate as a deterministic decision contract. Rather than extending analysis, it resolves it. Given a fixed set of diagnostic inputs and declared thresholds, governance produces a single authoritative outcome that specifies what interpretations and actions are allowed.

This contract does not optimize, negotiate, or average. It enforces exclusivity. One unit system governs interpretation, one compatibility assessment governs adjustment allowability, and one policy outcome is binding.

By framing governance as a contract rather than a recommendation, decision authority becomes explicit. Interpretation ends, execution begins, and accountability is preserved.
