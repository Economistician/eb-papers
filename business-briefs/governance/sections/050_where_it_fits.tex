\section*{Where Governance Fits in Forecast Readiness}

Governance is the terminal layer of the Forecast Readiness Framework. It consumes upstream diagnostics but does not reinterpret them. Its sole function is to declare admissible interpretation and authorized action.

Within the Electric Barometer stack, governance binds Demand Quantization Compatibility and Forecast Primitive Compatibility into a single, enforceable decision. This decision defines unit semantics, tolerance interpretation, readiness allowability, and compliance status.

Governance is not a performance metric and not an optimization target. It exists to constrain action, not to improve outcomes directly. When governance restricts adjustment, the correct response is representational or procedural change—not tuning.

By closing the decision surface deterministically, governance ensures that readiness decisions are structurally valid, auditable, and accountable by design. In this sense, governance is not an optional overlay—it is the necessary conclusion of operational forecasting.
