\section*{The Core Insight: Operations Have Tolerance Bands}

Operational systems are built to absorb a range of variation. Demand does not need to be forecast perfectly for execution to succeed; it needs to fall within a band that the operation can handle without disruption.

The key insight is that forecast performance should be evaluated relative to this tolerance. A forecast that stays within acceptable bounds most of the time may be far more valuable than one that is occasionally precise but frequently requires intervention. What matters is not how small errors are on average, but how often forecasts are good enough.

\HRtau\ captures this idea by measuring the share of intervals in which forecast error remains within a defined tolerance threshold. It reflects operational sufficiency rather than statistical precision, aligning evaluation with how systems actually function.

By focusing on tolerance compliance, \HRtau\ reframes accuracy as a binary, decision-relevant outcome: was the forecast usable without adjustment, or was it not? This shift brings evaluation closer to operational reality.
