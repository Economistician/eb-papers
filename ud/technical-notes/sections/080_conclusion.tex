\section{Conclusion}

Underbuild Depth provides a focused and interpretable measure of shortfall severity
in interval-based forecasting contexts. By averaging the magnitude of underbuilding
only over intervals in which shortfalls occur, \UD\ isolates the severity dimension
of forecast insufficiency that aggregate accuracy measures may obscure.

In operational environments where the cost of unmet demand increases with the depth
of a miss, \UD\ serves as a valuable diagnostic for assessing robustness and
identifying structural underforecasting patterns. When interpreted alongside
frequency-based and balance-oriented metrics, \UD\ contributes to a more complete
and actionable understanding of forecast readiness. Importantly, \UD\ functions as
an evaluative severity diagnostic rather than a prescriptive execution or control
rule, supporting readiness assessment without dictating operational decisions.
