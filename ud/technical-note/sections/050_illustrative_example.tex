\section{Illustrative Example}

To illustrate the behavior of \UD, consider an entity evaluated over twelve
intervals. Table~\ref{tab:ud_example} reports realized demand $y_t$, forecasted
demand $\yhat_t$, and the resulting shortfall depth
$s_t = \pospart{y_t - \yhat_t}$ for each interval.

\input{tables/050_ud_example_table}

Shortfalls occur in intervals 2, 3, 5, 7, and 9, with corresponding depths of
$3$, $3$, $3$, $4$, and $4$. The resulting Underbuild Depth is therefore
\[
\UD
=
\frac{3 + 3 + 3 + 4 + 4}{5}
=
3.4.
\]

This value indicates that, conditional on underbuilding occurring, the forecast
underestimates demand by an average of 3.4 units. Intervals in which forecasted
demand meets or exceeds realized demand do not contribute to the metric.

Figure~\ref{fig:ud_depths} visualizes the distribution of shortfall depths across
intervals for this example. The dashed horizontal line indicates the value of
\UD, highlighting the average severity of underbuilding relative to individual
shortfall events.
