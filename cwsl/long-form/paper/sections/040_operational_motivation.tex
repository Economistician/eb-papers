\section{Operational Motivation}

The consequences of forecast error depend not only on magnitude but on direction. In
many operational environments, under-forecasting creates service disruptions: unmet
demand, slower throughput, operational recovery time, and even reputational risk.
Over-forecasting, by contrast, typically results in manageable waste or slight
inefficiencies. This directional asymmetry forms the foundation for cost-weighted
evaluation.

Shortfalls may cause lost transactions, slower service, or staffing reallocations.
Overbuilds rarely require recovery; they simply incur modest excess. Across items,
dayparts, and locations, this asymmetry varies but is consistently present.
