% FRONTMATTER (Forecast Governance Technical Note)
% ==========================================================

\begin{abstract}
Operational forecasting systems increasingly embed evaluation diagnostics directly
into downstream decisions, policy gates, and automated readiness interventions.
In such settings, it is not sufficient to compute cost-aware error or service
metrics. One must also establish that both the \emph{units of interpretation} and
the \emph{forecast primitive itself} are structurally admissible for the observed
demand process.

This technical note introduces \emph{Forecast Governance} as a deterministic,
auditable decision contract that composes two companion diagnostics:
\emph{Demand Quantization Compatibility (DQC)}, which determines whether evaluation
and control must respect a discrete demand representation, and
\emph{Forecast Primitive Compatibility (FPC)}, which determines whether readiness
adjustment constitutes a valid control lever under that representation.

Governance produces a single authoritative artifact—the
\texttt{GovernanceDecision}—that specifies representation requirements, tolerance
semantics, readiness allowability, and compliance status with explicit rationale.
Forecast Governance is not a performance metric and is not an optimization
objective. It is a policy layer designed to ensure that evaluation semantics are
well-defined before downstream optimization, selection, or control is attempted.
