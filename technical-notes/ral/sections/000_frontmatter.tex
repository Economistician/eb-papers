\begin{abstract}
The Readiness Adjustment Layer (RAL) is a post-forecast control mechanism within
the Forecast Readiness Framework (FRF) designed to improve operational outcomes
under asymmetric cost structures. Rather than modifying or retraining forecasting
models, RAL applies bounded, deterministic adjustments to forecast outputs in order
to reduce cost-weighted service loss and mitigate systemic under-readiness risk.
By explicitly incorporating operational constraints and decision asymmetry, RAL
bridges the gap between predictive accuracy and executional readiness, enabling
forecast outputs that are more robust to irreversible or high-cost failures.
