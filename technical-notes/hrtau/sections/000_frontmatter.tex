% ==========================================================

\begin{abstract}
Hit Rate within Tolerance (\HRtau{}) measures the fraction of forecast intervals
whose absolute error lies within an acceptability band \(\tau\). While \HRtau{}
is simple and interpretable, its practical use depends critically on how the
tolerance \(\tau\) is specified. In many deployments, \(\tau\) is chosen
heuristically or fixed by convention, despite substantial heterogeneity in
acceptable error across entities, operating regimes, and decision contexts.

This technical note formalizes a sensitivity- and calibration-oriented treatment
of tolerance selection for \HRtau{}. We analyze \HRtau{} as a function of
\(\tau\), introduce grid-based sensitivity analysis to assess robustness to
tolerance assumptions, and present three deterministic, data-driven calibration
methods based on historical residuals: (i) target hit-rate (quantile-based)
selection, (ii) knee detection at diminishing returns, and (iii) utility
maximization trading coverage against tolerance width. Extensions to entity-level
tolerances and governance safeguards (floors, caps, and minimum-sample rules) are
discussed. The methods require no exogenous data, impose no model assumptions,
and are designed to support transparent, auditable deployment within the Forecast
Readiness Framework.
