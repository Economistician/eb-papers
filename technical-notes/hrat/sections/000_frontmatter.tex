\begin{abstract}
Hit Rate within Tolerance (HR@\(\tau\)) measures the proportion of forecast
intervals in which absolute error remains below an operationally meaningful
threshold. Rather than emphasizing exact numerical accuracy, the metric evaluates
how often a forecast is ``accurate enough'' to support stable execution. HR@\(\tau\)
is well suited to environments where small deviations are inconsequential but
out-of-tolerance misses introduce risk, inefficiency, or the need for corrective
action. By quantifying the empirical frequency of acceptable forecast performance,
HR@\(\tau\) provides a decision-oriented measure of practical reliability.
