# Hit Rate at Threshold (HR@τ) – Technical Note

This directory contains a technical note formalizing the **Hit Rate at Threshold (HR@τ)**
construct within the Electric Barometer evaluation framework.

HR@τ is introduced as a **threshold-based reliability metric** for assessing the
frequency with which forecasts satisfy a predefined operational criterion.

---

## Purpose

The purpose of this technical note is to define Hit Rate at Threshold (HR@τ) as a
probabilistic reliability measure indicating the proportion of forecast instances
that meet or exceed an operationally meaningful threshold.

This note exists to formalize HR@τ as a frequency-based performance indicator,
distinct from magnitude-based loss or depth measures.

## Relationship to Core Frameworks

Hit Rate at Threshold (HR@τ) is a derived construct within the Electric Barometer
ecosystem.

It is primarily used to:
- Quantify reliability with respect to operational thresholds
- Evaluate consistency of forecast performance across time or scenarios
- Complement binary coverage metrics such as No-Shortfall Level (NSL)
- Support readiness-aware evaluation alongside CWSL and FRF

HR@τ measures frequency of success, not severity of failure.

## Scope and Non-Scope

**In scope:**
- Definition of HR@τ as a threshold-based hit rate
- Interpretation as a probabilistic reliability metric
- Structural properties and operational meaning
- Use cases for readiness and deployment assessment

**Out of scope:**
- Magnitude of forecast error or loss (see CWSL)
- Shortfall severity or depth (see UD)
- Binary coverage at interval level (see NSL)
- Governance criteria for deployment readiness (see FRF)

## Status and Maturity

This technical note is maintained as a formal supporting artifact within the
Electric Barometer series.

Its contents may evolve as operational thresholds and evaluation regimes are
further refined.
