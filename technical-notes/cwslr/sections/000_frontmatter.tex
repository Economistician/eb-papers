\begin{abstract}
Cost-Weighted Service Loss (CWSL) evaluates forecast performance under asymmetric
penalties for underbuild and overbuild, parameterized by a cost ratio
$R = c_u / c_o$. While CWSL provides a flexible and interpretable metric, its
practical use depends critically on how the cost ratio $R$ is specified.
In operational settings, $R$ is often selected heuristically or treated as
fixed, despite substantial uncertainty and heterogeneity in cost asymmetry
across entities and regimes.

This technical note formalizes a sensitivity- and calibration-oriented treatment
of the cost ratio in asymmetric forecast evaluation. We analyze CWSL as a
function of $R$, introduce grid-based sensitivity analysis to assess robustness
to cost assumptions, and present deterministic, data-driven methods for
selecting $R$ based on historical imbalance between underbuild and overbuild
costs. Extensions to entity-level calibration and practical governance
considerations are discussed. The methods require no exogenous data, impose no
model assumptions, and are designed to support transparent, auditable deployment
within the Forecast Readiness Framework.
