\begin{abstract}
The Forecast Readiness Score (FRS) is a composite diagnostic that evaluates how
well a forecasting system supports operational execution. By combining two
complementary components—the No--Shortfall Level (NSL), which measures the
reliability of meeting demand, and the Cost--Weighted Service Loss (CWSL), represented
in scaled form as \CWSLscaled{} to capture normalized asymmetric economic penalties—%
FRS summarizes both service protection and cost discipline in a single,
interpretable score. Unlike symmetric statistical accuracy metrics, FRS emphasizes
the operational consequences of error, providing a readiness-oriented perspective
particularly suited for environments where shortfalls, cost asymmetry, and
execution feasibility matter as much as numerical deviation. This technical note
introduces the formal definition, properties, motivation, and use cases of FRS
within the Forecast Readiness Framework.
