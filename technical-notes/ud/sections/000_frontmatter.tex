% ==========================================================

\begin{abstract}
Underbuild Depth (UD) measures the average magnitude of forecast shortfalls,
conditional on a shortfall occurring. While coverage-based metrics describe how
often forecasts meet realized demand, UD isolates the severity of underbuilding
events when they occur. The metric provides a focused diagnostic for environments
in which deep misses create disproportionate operational disruption, and it is
well suited to interval-based forecasting contexts where the cost of unmet demand
increases with the size of the shortfall.
