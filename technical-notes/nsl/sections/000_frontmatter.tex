\begin{abstract}
The No-Shortfall Level (NSL) measures the proportion of intervals in which
forecasted demand meets or exceeds realized demand. NSL captures interval-level
forecast reliability by focusing on the occurrence of shortfalls rather than their
magnitude. The metric is interpretable, scale-invariant, and applicable across
operational settings in which meeting demand within each interval is critical.
