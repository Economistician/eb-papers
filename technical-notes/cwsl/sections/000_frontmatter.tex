\begin{abstract}
Cost-Weighted Service Loss (CWSL) quantifies the asymmetric operational impact
of forecast error by applying explicit penalties to underbuild and overbuild.
Traditional symmetric accuracy metrics treat positive and negative deviations
equivalently, but in many operational environments—production, staffing,
logistics, inventory, and energy systems—the cost of underforecasting often
significantly outweighs the cost of surplus. CWSL encodes this asymmetry
directly and normalizes by realized demand, making the metric interpretable as
the effective fraction of throughput “lost’’ due to misalignment between
forecasted and actual values. This technical note presents the formal definition,
properties, motivation, and illustrative examples of CWSL, and outlines how it
supports readiness-oriented forecast evaluation within the Forecast Readiness
Framework.
