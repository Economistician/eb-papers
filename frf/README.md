# Forecast Readiness Framework (FRF)

The Forecast Readiness Framework (FRF) is the foundational framework within the
Electric Barometer research program.

FRF provides a governance- and decision-oriented structure for evaluating when
forecasting systems are suitable for operational deployment. Rather than focusing
solely on statistical accuracy, FRF emphasizes readiness, asymmetry, and
managerial actionability.

## Role Within Electric Barometer

FRF serves as the conceptual anchor for the Electric Barometer ecosystem.

It defines:
- The notion of *forecast readiness* as distinct from predictive accuracy
- The evaluative context in which asymmetric loss metrics are interpreted
- The governance boundary between analytical performance and operational use

Other constructs within Electric Barometer—such as Cost-Weighted Service Loss
(CWSL), No-Shortfall Level (NSL), Underbuild Depth (UD), and related diagnostics—are
defined relative to the evaluative perspective established by FRF.

## Repository Structure

This directory is organized as follows:

- `paper/`  
  Contains the canonical FRF manuscript, including all sections, figures, tables,
  and references.

- `technical-notes/`  
  Reserved for future technical extensions or clarifications related to FRF.

- `business-notes/`  
  Reserved for future practitioner- or executive-facing summaries of the framework.

## Scope

This directory contains the authoritative FRF framework paper and related
materials. Implementation details, empirical studies, and code artifacts are
maintained elsewhere in the Electric Barometer ecosystem.
